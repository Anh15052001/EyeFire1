# Face Recogntion using Model FaceNet
+ FaceNet implement face recognition
# Train model
+ The first, you must install library in requirements.txt: pip install -r requirements.txt
+ The second, you cd to directory _03_facenet_keras
+ The third, you can train model with your dataset in directory data with file recognizer.ipynb
# Recognition
+ You can run 03_face_recognizer_image.py so that face recognition through image
+ You can run 03_face_recognizer_camera.py so that face recognition through webcam
# Detect Threshold Blur
+ The first, you can crop face from dataset by file: gen_face_data.py
+ The second, you can find value threshold blur through file: detect_threshold_blur.py

+ NOTE: OUR DATASET GEN FACE DATA INCLUDE: DONAL TRUMP, ELON MUSK, MESSI, PEP AND PARK HANG SEO
